## Abstract

One of the main challenges when creating a simulator of human behavior is to suppress the perpetuation of discriminatory biases present in human decision making. Several approaches to deal with this problem have already been proposed in Artificial Intelligence literature. Such proposals generally consist of the definition of metrics developed to quantify the discrimination resulting from an artificial intelligence model and the application of such metrics in the generation of the model to limit the discriminatory effects generated. However, limiting the discrimination of a model causes the average error of it to increase, generating a scenario of conflict between these metrics. In this project, we propose a methodology that uses multi-objective optimization that simultaneously optimizes the performance of the models and the quality of the prediction in sensitive groups (which may suffer discrimination). Focusing on binary classification problems, we seek to find the set of the best models for such metrics. We compared our approach with other well-known methodologies in the area, using Logistic Regression as a comparison reference. The proposed methodology obtained promising results, being able to reduce the discrimination of artificial intelligence models together with the maintenance of accurate performance.
