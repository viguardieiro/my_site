Hi! I am currently a research scientist at the Visualization and Data Analytics Research Center ([VIDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/)) at New York University ([NYU](https://www.nyu.edu/)), under the supervision of professor [Claudio Silva](https://ctsilva.github.io/). 

Previously, I was a Master's student at the Visual Data Science Lab ([V-DS](http://www.visualdslab.com/)) in the School of Applied Mathematics ([EMAp](https://emap.fgv.br/)) of Fundação Getulio Vargas ([FGV](https://portal.fgv.br/)), where I worked with professors [Jorge Poco](http://visualdslab.com/~jpocom/) and [Marcos M. Raimundo](https://ic.unicamp.br/~mraimundo/) (from [Unicamp](https://ic.unicamp.br/en/)). I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV/EMAp in 2020 under the supervision of Jorge Poco and Marcos M. Raimundo. 

My current research focuses on visualization systems for Explainable AI and Topological Data Analysis. I previously researched Multi-Objective Machine Learning and the development of Fair ML models.
