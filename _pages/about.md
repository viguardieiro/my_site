Hi! I am currently a Master's student at the Visual Data Science Lab in the [School of Applied Mathematics (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/) of [Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV)](https://portal.fgv.br/). I earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV in 2020. As part of my professional life, I worked with Mathematical Optimization and Computer Vision. For more information about my background, visit my [curriculum](/cv/).

I am interested in Machine Learning, Optimization (with a focus but not limited to Multi-Objective Optimization), and Statistics. My current research is focused on developing ethical Machine Learning models, specifically employing Multi-Objective Optimization and Ensemble Learning methods to learn fair ML models.
