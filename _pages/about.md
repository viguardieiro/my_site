Hi! I am currently a Master's student at the Visual Data Science Lab in the [School of Applied Mathematics (EMAp)](https://emap.fgv.br/) of [Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV)](https://portal.fgv.br/). I earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV in 2020. As part of my professional life, I worked with Mathematical Optimization and Computer Vision. For more information about my background, visit my [curriculum](/cv/).

I am particularly interested in the development of ethical Machine Learning models and Artificial Intelligence auditing. My research is focused on the use of Multi-Objective Optimization and Ensemble Learning methods to enforce Fairness in Machine Learning Models.

I am still working on this site :)
