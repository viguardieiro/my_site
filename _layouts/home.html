<h1>About</h1> 

<p>Hi! I am currently a Master&#39;s student at the Visual Data Science Lab (<a href="http://www.visualdslab.com/">V-DS</a>) in the 
    School of Applied Mathematics (<a href="https://emap.fgv.br/">EMAp</a>) of 
    Fundação Getulio Vargas (<a href="https://portal.fgv.br/">FGV</a>), working with professors <a href="https://vgc.poly.edu/~jpocom/">Jorge Poco</a> 
    and <a href="https://marcosmrai.github.io/">Marcos M. Raimundo</a>.
    I obtained my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV/EMAp in 2020 under the supervision of Jorge Poco and Marcos M. Raimundo. 
    As part of my professional life, I worked with Mathematical Optimization and Computer Vision. 
    For more information about my background, visit my <a href="/cv/">curriculum</a>.</p>
    
<p>I am interested in Machine Learning, Optimization (with a focus but not limited to Multi-Objective Optimization), and Statistics. 
    My current research is focused on developing ethical Machine Learning models, specifically employing Multi-Objective Optimization 
    and Ensemble Learning methods to learn fair ML models.</p>
