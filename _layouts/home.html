<h1>About</h1> 

<p>Hi! I am currently a Master&#39;s student at the Visual Data Science Lab in the 
    <a href="https://emap.fgv.br/">School of Applied Mathematics (EMAp)</a> of 
    <a href="https://portal.fgv.br/">Fundação Getulio Vargas (FGV)</a>. 
    I earned my B.S. in Applied Mathematics from FGV in 2020. 
    As part of my professional life, I worked with Mathematical Optimization and Computer Vision. 
    For more information about my background, visit my <a href="/cv/">curriculum</a>.</p>
    
<p>I am particularly interested in the development of ethical Machine Learning models and 
    Artificial Intelligence auditing. My research is focused on the use of Multi-Objective 
    Optimization and Ensemble Learning methods to enforce Fairness in Machine Learning Models.</p>

<p>I am still working on this site :)</p>
